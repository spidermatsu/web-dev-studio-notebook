      The web is fucked is one manifesto that really stands out to me because of it’s alignment with my beliefs – the tendrils of Big Tech’s neoliberal technocaptialism affecting and sucking the soul out of the individual, ‘old’ web. It won’t change, so as an individual you must take control of your presence to remove your vulnerability as the average person on the web – someone who produces data points to be sold, someone with no privacy, and someone who has had artificial compulsions instilled in them by the habit-forming nature of social media. Don’t be a social media shill! Break your screen addiction, understand why these things happen and interact with the web on your own terms and not their terms.

      The next one I’m exploring is I love the web.  I agree with the concept of returning excitement to the web by prioritising free sharing and a personal website– putting things online with no care as to whether people see them or not, as opposed to the pull of social media platforms in which heavy emphasis is placed on the attention you receive. Social media creates a user-hostile web. Websites and blogs become less organically passionate – They’re only looking at ways to make money. The personal web is one of which everyone maintains their won corner of cyberspace. It’s not supposed to sell you something -  but it may influence you to read something that brings joy to another netizen.

My manifesto:
After this is marked, I’m putting it on Neocities.
You don’t have a lot of time in this life and yet everyone loves to waste your time. We are constantly being bombarded with habit-forming technology and an excess of information which lacks all the wonder, desire and synchronous suspense that comes with conversation! It’s a doomed and perilous existence and we cannot ever go back to the way it was before. Ever. 
To those who don’t believe that being given funny reels is a worthy exchange for your time being taken from you in the form of an artificial compulsion to check social media, I present Caitlin Begg’s Progression to Analog:
The backdrop of this website is an Indian fabric shop.
In my culture, we sew our own clothes out of fabric we buy from someone else in our community.
In my world, a web continues to be a diverse community OF communities, an experience which is scrapped into existence by hand. People come together to share their passions without needing to get something in return. We are styled according to who we are, not styled according to what we see or have been influenced to buy.
Before our community was exploited to mass-produce clothes, the clothes we did buy were worn and worn and worn until they were scraps, and then those scraps became cloths for cleaning the floor. They were discarded when they became nothing. Do not let monetises social pressure (social media) make you feel like you need to purchase a uniform and conform to a certain style that looks good, or that subculture starts and ends with ‘-core’
It doesn’t! Dress for your life. Buy clothes in real life, with cash, and haggle wherever possible. Walk outside for no reason, wander by yourself and bask in solitude – it’s really important to practice solitude in temporally weird moments because it’s essential for your brain.
Also, throw your phone in a lake!
I don’t have social media anymore.
I’m Haleema and I like to read books, produce music and listen to the radio on my old cd player. I am most mentally enriched when I’m on the train or in dance class. I don’t look at ads, click on ads or agree with ads. They are vultures
